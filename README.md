# "Year In Pixels"

A mood tracking app that lets the user log their mood for every day of the year. The format will follow the "year in 
pixels" template, which assigns a square/pixel to each day of the year. Different colours will be used to represent 
different moods. Additional features could include: 
- A summary of the user's mood inputs. For example, the number of days in total
they felt "sad" or "happy" or "average"
- Letting the users customize mood options
- Having the option to add a small comment for each day

## Who will use it?
Anyone who have the habit of using tracking/logging tools for mental health or organization purposes.
This program provides a minimalistic and concise way to record of one's mood pattern throughout the year.

## Why I Chose This Project?
An online mood tracker is something I personally would use regularly. I have tried keeping a physical mood logging 
sheet, but it became very inconvenient to have the paper and different coloured pens with me at all times. Having an 
online version of this would be much simpler and more motivating to keep up with because the logging process will be 
less time-consuming. On top of that, it would be fun and useful to implement additional functionality such as a mood 
summary or comments.

## User story:
Phase 1:
- As a user, I would want to be able to create a mood board of any size I choose
- As a user, I would want to be able to choose a starting date
- As a user, I would want to see the date and month associated with each day
- As a user, I would want to have a selection of moods to choose from
- As a user, I would want to see a summary of the number of days I've felt each mood
- As a user, I would want to assign a mood to a specific day
- As a user, I would want to be able to change the mood of a specific day

Phase 2:
- As a user, I want to be able to save my mood tracker at any point (if I so choose)
- As a user, at the start of the application, I want to be able to load my mood tracker from file (if I so choose)
